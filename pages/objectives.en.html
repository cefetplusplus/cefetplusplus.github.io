        <p>A competition team benefits students in their academic formation and preparation for entering the 
            job market. It exercises essential skills such as logical reasoning, teamwork, application of 
            knowledge acquired throughout their education, and improvement of programming and problem-solving 
            abilities.</p>

        <p>In addition to the benefits to the students of our team, the Computer and Engineering courses at 
            the Divin√≥polis campus and the CEFET-MG as a whole are also benefited, as the team highlights 
            the institution among other universities, attracting the attention of companies that always 
            follow competitive programming events.</p>

        <p>Our main goal is to consolidate the CEFET++ team to be on par with teams from other institutions 
            that traditionally stand out in the top positions of the national finals. As a result, it is 
            expected that this project will:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Encourage CEFET-MG students to deepen their studies in the area they have chosen for 
                    their education.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attract the attention of students in the final stages of high school for the Computer 
                    and Engineering courses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, attract the attention of companies for the professionals who graduated from 
                    CEFET-MG.
                </li>
            </ul>

            A competitive programming team is also important as a project that operates under the indivisibility 
            of teaching, research, and outreach programs.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Teaching</strong>, because it covers contents of various disciplines and the didactic 
                    practice exercised by the guiding professors and collaborating students in training other 
                    students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Research</strong>, because it encourages the constant search for new techniques and 
                    efficient solutions for solving known problems and developing solution strategies for open 
                    problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outreach Programs</strong>, because it prepares students to work on projects that 
                    apply the knowledge acquired in contests.
